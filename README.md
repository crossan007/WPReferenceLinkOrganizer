I'm among the guilty who amass tens or hundreds of "open browser tabs."  The mentality is consistent with each open tab: "this was a helpful site, I might not be quite finished with it yet"; only to be forgotten days or weeks later.  I don't want to bookmark the tab, because let's face it: bookmarks are a long forgotten wasteland of "sites once visited"

In an effort to become a better internet citizen (and steward of my system's RAM), I'm developing this WordPress plugin to help me store links to resources in a manner conducive to future recall:

*  Storing a "title" and short "blurb" about each resource
*  Defining "how difficult" a particular  resource was to find (the scale ranges from "Front page of Google" to "[DenverCoder9's](https://xkcd.com/979/) Home Address")
*  The URL
*  Free-form "tags" (from a dynamically built taxonomy)
